# QuickChar

Quickly find and choose the equivalent locale character for an ascii character

- Place all files in one directory
- Run `quickchar`
- Press (at this moment) Super+Alt+C to call the window

# N.B.

- The character data file just contains a few samples (a, e, c, n). Needs to be populated soon
- depends on:

 - Gtk, Wnck, Gdk, Gio, Keybinder
 - pyperclip
 - pyautogui (Pip install)
 - xlib (to run pyautogui)
